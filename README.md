# **Welcome to my Portfolio Website**

View my portfolio website [here](https://chimsara.netlify.app/).

## **Tech Stack**
This website was created with Javascript and ReactJS. 
I used CSS for styling.

## **What I learned**

### Responsive Navigation 
* How to change the apperance of a Navigation Bar depending on the size of a screen.
### Deployment with React Router
* I encountered an issue where my website wasn't deploying correctly. I realized that Netlify could not locate my `index.html` file due to my use of Routes. 
* I learned that when deploying a project to Netlify that uses Routes, you need a `_redirects` file in your build directory so that Netlify knows where the `index.html` file is located. 
### Map function in ReactJS 
* When using the map function, you must give each child component a unique _key prop_.
### CSS Grid
* I realized instead of using Flexbox, CSS Grid would allow me to to stack components if they reach a certain length.
### CSS Variables
* Varibales are delared in the root of a website. The use of them quickens workflow.
